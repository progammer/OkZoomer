# OkZoomer
Unfortunately, recent events - such as COVID-19 :( - have caused education to be adapted to a virtual format. An annoying problem I faced last semester was navigating through different portals (email and canvas) to retrieve Zoom meeting links to my classes. Modern problems require modern solutions - so I built this chrome extension to mitigate the hassle. 

This is my first major project dealing in HTML/CSS/JS [apologizes for any subpar code], and I would appreciate anyone more experienced than me to review it.

## Workflow
- Select the folder containing resources + manifest file for extension
- chrome://extensions > Load Unpacked

## Usage
- Navigate to the Chrome Web Store
- Search for "OK Zoomer"
- (or if this link works: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ok-zoomer/jbnbkdnmmdndfglombmgmbccfccjkidg)
- Install and Use
