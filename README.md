# OkZoomer
Modern problems require modern solutions. Unfortunately, recent events - such as COVID-19 :( - have caused education to be adapted to a virtual format. An annoying problem I faced last semester was navigating through different portals (email, canvas, announcements) to retrieve Zoom meeting links.
To mitigate this hassle, here is a Google Chrome Extension that serves as a portal to these classes. 

## Workflow
- Select the folder containing resources + manifest file for extension
- chrome://extensions > Load Unpacked

## Usage
- Navigate to the Chrome web Store
- Search for "OK Zoomer"
- Install and Use
